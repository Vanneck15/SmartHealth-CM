# SmartHealth CM is an Android mobile application that securely centralizes users’ medical information (medical history, prescriptions, test results, allergies, blood type) directly on their smartphone. Designed for the realities of Cameroon, where medical records are mostly paper-based, the app enables quick access to health history, even in emergency situations, with medication reminders and an emergency mode displaying vital information. Powered by cloud services, notifications, and a smart assistant, SmartHealth CM improves personal health tracking, supports healthcare providers, and has the potential to save lives.
